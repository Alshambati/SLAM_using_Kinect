This project involved the implementation of Visual SLAM and RTAB-Map SLAM on a small-scale autonomous robot. Using a compact SoC computer, a controller, and a Kinect camera, I was able to achieve excellent results despite not having prior experience in this specialized field. This project sparked my passion for robotics research, and I hope to further develop this work in the future to benefit my local community, particularly in the field of agriculture. I am determined to continue exploring this area because I firmly believe in its potential to make a meaningful difference
